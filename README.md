### Interlude 

<details>
<summary>Friendly Fire</summary>

Along a crowded street headed to the waterfront, two dock workers shoot the breeze.

“Did you hear the throne changed hands again?”

“Really?! I just got used to the new queen, or rather I got used to avoiding the new queen’s minions. Who’s the new ruler?”

“Varis Galanodel. He used to work for the queen, I think”

“Wait, wasn’t he in charge of the library for a while? I’m pretty sure that’s ‘the disorganized goober’ that Atlavast used to complain about on trivia nights. Something about a new card catalog, maybe?”

“Yeah, that’s the same guy. Some adventurers overthrew the queen or something, I guess he was the next choice. Maybe he’ll be better, or at least less cruel than the last two. I also heard Varis’s queen is a goddess”

“That good looking, huh?”

“No, I mean, yeah, she’s gorgeous, but I was saying she’s literally a goddess. Goddess of a silver forest or maybe nature in general, I can’t remember”

“Think the new guy will be any good?”

“I mean, he can’t be worse. Seems like he’s on the right track. There’s a justice system now, so no more vengeful guards locking people away. Apparently, you have to prove someone did something wrong before execution, and get this, they even get a chance to defend themselves! He also has a plan for kid’s schools, if you can believe it. I guess instead of apprenticeships, kids will go to school for a bit. I don’t know, I feel like the workforce is going to miss the 6-12 year olds that made up the backbone of menial labor.”

“Who is gonna pay for all of that? Taxes will be crushing”

“That’s the thing, I think for now a lot of the process is being funded by the nobles. I think they’re paying more and nothing is changing for us. I think it's penance for the way they treated the chasm district under the queen. He was going to throw them out of the city and take over the trade houses if they didn’t agree. After word spread about how he fire-balled the queen and her priestess, they all buckled pretty quick”

“Did you hear about the big party at the castle last week?”

“No, what was it for?”

“I heard it was in honor of the group of adventurers, probably the same ones that overthrew the queen”

“Oh, right. The fiery freaks? The friendly feinds? The fainting fairies? Gosh, what was their name? They planted all the talking trees too, right?

“Those are treants, they sealed off the underdark and reinforced the city, acting as eyes and ears for any imminent danger. And the adventurers are called The Friendly Fire. Varis named them protectors of the city, so they’re at least on our side and not just a bunch of money hungry mercenaries”

“Their name could be better”

“Regardless, I’m sure Varis will ask them to help keep the city safe, maybe even make improvements, like with the trees”

<summary> Friendly Fire </summary>

```
-The party visited the new concert hall, played some game of chance and Nepe played music for the concert hall where she played 3 songs and won wide acclaim for her "Brown Note" song.
-At the concert hall we met a high elf sorcerer named Olinath, who agreed to accompany us on our next adventure.  
-Aspen scouted the Pirate base, and determined that there is no easy way to get into the floating island, but determined that the party could take a boat to nearby the island then fly up to it.  It does not appear to have a guard stationed.  There are a few boats moored at the base of the chain, but no discernable way to get up to the floating island.  
-Varis transported the party to Phandalin, where we determined that our home base is in good shape, and the south woods are being cut down to expand the farmland (Apples & Mushrooms).  Aspen casted plant growth on the mushroom farm, causing some distress to the gardeners trying to keep up. Received 1000 gold from the company profits, 2 potions of flying, and sent a message to Adabra for potions of speed, heroism and invisibility.  Transported samples of wine back to Varis to build the business.  
-Visited the House of Knowledge, helped Atlavast find some books to support the school.  Also found a book, Zepherian Tome, that Bruce was able to decipher with his knowledge of the giant language.  The Book has a trapped Genie named Gaze Azam that wants to be set free.  The genie was helping the wizard, Zikron build a flying castle when he trapped him in the book.  The genie said the only way to be set free was if the wizard dies, or intentionally sets the genie free.  If freed, the genie agreed to help the party finish the floating castle, and grant 1 wish.  The wizard is located near Waterdeep.  
-The party decided to go to confront the wizard and went to the docks to book passage to Waterdeep, but found that a massive amount of deep sea creatures were being pushed out from the depths into fisherman nets.  The party investigated the strange occurrence bringing the fish up from the depths by joining the crew of a fishing boat.  While fishing, 2 large ~16-20 foot hunter sharks attacked the party and one was killed by the fishermen, and promptly pulled underwater by a massive force.  The other shark fled that force. The party determined that whatever could eat that giant shark was massive indeed.  The fishing boat captain worried that whatever it was could cause major carnage in Neverwinter.  
-Upon returning we stopped at the Tradehouse where we traded 350 garnets for the Amulet of Health.  The vendor, Volen, also had a Belt of Hill Giant Strength.  Balazar said if a belt of Storm, Cloud or Fire Giant Strength came in his possession let us know first.  He promised with the offering of a copper bowl with inlaid lapis luzi.  Additionally, Nepe insisted on buying Balazar some pants.  He received compliments on the stylish Navy Blue pants with gold slashes and crowds stopped giving him an abnormally wide berth.
-The party reported the incident with the sea monster to Varis, who is going to put the city guard on alert and prepare plans for evacuation.
-The party then decided to get teleported to Phandalin, then transit by land to Waterdeep in effort to find the wizard and set the genie free.  
3 story lines:
1. Free the genie, get a floating castle (A way to assault the Pirates Island?) A wish (for Nepe to forget the Brown note song?)
2. Free the pirates from their floating island
3. Save the town from the giant sea beast
